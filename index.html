      <p>Hey there! If you've found your way here, then I'm pretty sure you want to know more about me so let's get started.
      I am currently a junior at Cornell University and I'm studying Information Sciences with a focus on User Experience and Networks/Crowds/Markets.
      So far, I have learned about basic programming, objects-oriented programming, front-end web development, and back-end web development.
      I really enjoy working with computers and enjoy figuring out more ways to interact with them.
      Below, I have included some projects I've worked on that can demonstrate my knowledge.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <h2> Mediocre Melodies </h2>
          <a href="https://mediocre-melodies.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="mediocre_melodies.png" alt="melodies"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> This was a group project done for an on-campus client named Mediocre Melodies. This project tested my creativity, requiring
             me to cater to design choices of the client while maintaining thematic unity and balancing unique design with user experience and functionality.
            I also learned how implement a form which will return results to the president of the student committee when submitted.
            Most importantly, this project also served to improve my leadership and teamwork abilities.</p>

          <h2>Miralrio Landscaping</h2>
          <a href="https://miralrio-landscaping.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="landscaping.png" alt="landscaping"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> Miralrio Landscaping was another group project done for a client where I developed my database skills. It incorporated the use of php and SQL to include
          functions that customers might find helpful while reducing work for the client. Some functions include the quotes page and the tagging of pictures. This project also
          allowed me to demonstrate clean, simple, UI and focus more on user experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
          <h2>Pokemon Gallery</h2>
          <a href="https://pokemon-gallery.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="pokemon.png" alt="pokemon"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> An independent project done for class that demonstrates my backend knowledge. I was required to create a site that allowed uploading, deleting, and tagging of
          pictures from the database while logged in. The login function also allowed me to experience a little bit about hashing, security, and sessions. Test it yourself! (login:seedData,pass:12345)</p>

  <h1>Programming languages I'm familiar with</h1>
  <p>Click to learn about my experience with each:</p>

<div class="description">
  <div id="b1" class="containerTab">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>I have 3 years of experience in Java from highschool and from UIL competitions. I also have one semester of more advanced Java from
    a college class about objects-oriented programming where we worked on many different topics. While it has been a long time since I have
    wielded Java, my solid foundation in this language will allow me to work with it seamlessly.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b2" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>I have one semester of college experience with Python where we learned about the basics of programming. However, this short length of usage
    doesn't mean that I'm not well-versed in Python since the class covered the language extensively. I am confident in my skills regarding
    Python and consider myself proficient in the language.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b3" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>I have used HTML extensively and worked for several different clients. My projects are linked above and I am very confident in my HTML proficiency.
    While there is still a lot to learn in designing webpages, with my HTML knowledge, I would have no problem improving in the design department.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b4" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Similar to HTML, since both are required for webpage development, I have used CSS a lot and am confident in the language.
    I have yet to dive deep into the more complex styling choices available but with time, I can improve in that aspect.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="b5" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>I have used JavaScript for certain webpage development projects and am familiar with how to use it but would not consider myself well-versed in the language.
      However, it would not be an issue for me to work with JavaScript after familiarizing myself with it for a brief period.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b6" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>I know the basics of database creation in SQL as well as how to initiate, extract, and input information. However, I would not say I am proficient
    since I have only used SQL for one semester of college.</p>
