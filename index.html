      <p>Hey there! If you've found your way here, then I'm pretty sure you want to know more about me so let's get started.
      I am currently a junior at Cornell University and I'm studying Information Sciences with focus on User Experience and Networks/Crowds/Markets.
      So far, I have learned about basic programming, objects-oriented programming, front-end web development, and back-end web development.
      I really enjoy working with computers and how we can interact with them. Below, I have included some projects I've worked on in the past that can demonstrate my knowledge
      along with other interesting information.</p>

          <h2> Mediocre Melodies </h2>
          <a href="https://mediocre-melodies.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="mediocre_melodies.png" alt="melodies"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> This was a group project done for a client, which was the organization known as Mediocre Melodies. This project tested my creativity in design decisions
          while requiring me to maintain some semblance of thematic unity. The project also served to improve my leadership and teamwork abilities.</p>

          <h2>Miralrio Landscaping</h2>
          <a href="https://miralrio-landscaping.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="landscaping.png" alt="landscaping"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> Miralrio Landscaping was another group project done for a client where I developed my database skills. It incorporated the use of php and SQL to included
          functions that customers might find helpful while reducing work for the client such as tagging images as well as the quotes page.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <h2>Pokemon Gallery</h2>
          <a href="https://pokemon-gallery.herokuapp.com/"><img class="pic" src="pokemon.png" alt="pokemon"></a>
          <p class="project_info"> An independent project done for class that demonstrates my backend knowledge. I was required to use a database that allowed uploading, deleting, and tagging of
          pictures from the database while logged in. The login function also allowed me to experience a little bit about hashing, security, and sessions.(login:seedData,pass:12345)</p>

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>I have 3 years of experience in Java from highschool and form UIL competitions. I also have one semester of more advanced Java from
    a college class about objects-oriented programming where we worked on many different topics. While it has been a long time since I have
  wielded Java, a quick refresh will allow me to use it smoothly.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b2" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>I have one semester of college experience with Python where we learned about the basics of programming. However, this short length of usage
    doesn't necesarily mean that I'm not well-versed in Python becasue I consdier myself proficient in this language and am confident in my coding
    skills</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b3" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>As my projects demonstrate, I have used HTML extensively and worked for different clients. I am very confident in my HTML proficiency and it
    can be considered my best language.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b4" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS is in the same situation as HTML and I have worked with it quite a bit. I am similarly very confident in my CSS proficiency. It can be considered my
    second best language.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b5" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>I have used JavaScript for certain webpage development projects and am familiar with how to use it but would not consider myself well-versed in javascript
    until I have a little more practice with it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="b6" class="containerTab hidden">
    <span onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none'" class="closebtn">x</span>
    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>I know the basics of database creation in SQL as well as how to initiate, extract, and input information. However, I would not say I am proficient
    since I have only used SQL for one semester of college.</p>
